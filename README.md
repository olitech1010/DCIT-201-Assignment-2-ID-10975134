# THE QUESTION

Create a class called "Book" that has the following properties:
•	Title (String)
•	Author (String)
•	ISBN (String)
•	Publication Date (String)
•	Number of Pages (int)
The class should also have the following methods:
•	A method to return the title of the book.
•	A method to return the author of the book.
•	A method to return the ISBN of the book.
•	A method to return the publication date of the book.
•	A method to return the number of pages of the book.
•	A method to set the title of the book.
•	A method to set the author of the book.
•	A method to set the ISBN of the book.
•	A method to set the publication date of the book.
•	A method to set the number of pages of the book.
•	A method to check if the book is a long book (more than 500 pages).
•	A method to check if the book is a recent publication (publication date is within the last 5 years).
 ⁃ Once you have created the "Book" class, create a driver class that creates a few Book objects and sets and gets their properties. 

 Then, use the methods you created in the Book class to check if each book is a long book and a recent publication.



# Movie.java
 Create a Movie class that has the following fields:
•	title (String)
•	director (String)
•	releaseYear (int)
•	duration (int) in minutes
•	rating (double)
Implement the following methods in the Movie class:
•	A constructor that takes in all the fields as parameters and initializes them.
•	getTitle() and setTitle() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the title field.
•	getDirector() and setDirector() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the director field.
•	getReleaseYear() and setReleaseYear() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the releaseYear field.
•	getDuration() and setDuration() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the duration field.
•	getRating() and setRating() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the rating field.
•	isLongMovie() method that returns true if the movie's duration is more than 2 hours (120 minutes), and false otherwise.
•	isHighlyRated() method that returns true if the movie's rating is higher than 4.0, and false otherwise.
Create a driver class that creates 3 Movie objects, sets their values, and then retrieves and displays all the fields of each object. 
Use the methods you implemented in the Movie class to print whether each movie is a long movie or a highly rated movie.
